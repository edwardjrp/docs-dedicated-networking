             Load balancers must have at least one virtual IP address that clients
             can use to balance traffic across nodes. You can use the manage virtual IPs
             operations to configure and manage the virtual IP addresses for the load
             balancer with the specified device ID.

             An IP can be passed into the add Virtual IP call as part of the request body,
             only if the IP exists within an existing Virtual.
