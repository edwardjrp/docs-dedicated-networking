------------------------------------------

This Getting Started information shows how to send requests by using the `cURL command line

.. note:: 
    
     For API development, testing and workflow management in a graphical environment, try
     interacting with the API by using an application such as
     `Postman`_  or `RESTClient for Firefox`_.
